GAME SPOTLIGHT : CODENAMES

I want to start a fun new series here! Spotlighting games, probably games i love but maybe not! And just reviewing, recommending, maybe giving tips and gameplay preferences! So excited for this :) i’m a huge game fiend, i love word games, board games, social deduction games, online games, room escape games, you name it! It’s not on a schedule, just as i feel like, but probably definitely recurring!

GAME SPOTLIGHT : CODENAMES 

I want to start a fun new series here where i spotlight different games! Also I’m not a professional reviewer, this is just for fun! I’ll just be introducing, reviewing, recommending, maybe giving tips and gameplay preferences! I want to have a set format by which i review each game, so if anyone has advice for what they’d like to see i’m all ears! So excited for this :) i’m a huge game fiend, i love word games, board games, social deduction games, online games, room escape games, you name it! It’s not on a schedule, just as i feel like, but definitely recurring!

Rules: Codenames is played 

Codenames, by , is one of my top 3 games! Its just the right mix of challenging, fun, social, and strategic. I love being the spymaster. Theres a few rules tweaks that change based on the group, but i’m of the opinion that wordplay in the codename-giving is in the spirit of the game. For example, if you have three thematically unrelated clues left, you can instead focus on the linguistic links in the words. If your team’s three remaining words end in -tion, and theres no other such words on the board, you should be able to give a linguistic clue over a thematic one.
