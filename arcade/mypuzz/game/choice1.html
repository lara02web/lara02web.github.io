    <h3>You amble deeper into the forest and come across two frogs sitting before a fork in the path.
        You have heard of these legendary frogs... 
        One always lies and the other always tells the truth!
        You recall something else... you can ask only one question of one of the frogs.
        Since you are familiar with this trick, you ask the first frog, 'Which way would the other frog tell me to go?'   
        It replies, 'Right'.            
        Which way do you go? </h3>
